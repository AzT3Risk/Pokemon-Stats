Pokémon also known as Pocket Monsters in Japan, is a media franchise managed by The Pokémon Company. The franchise was created by Satoshi Tajiri in 1995,[6] and is centered on fictional creatures called "Pokémon", which humans, known as Pokémon Trainers, catch and train to battle each other for sport.

# Pokemon with stats
## About the dataset:
This data set includes 721 Pokemon, including their number, name, first and second type, and basic stats: HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. 

The columns of the dataset described as follows:

* #: ID for each pokemon
*  Name: Name of each pokemon

* Type 2: Some pokemon are dual type and have 2
* Total: sum of all stats that come after this, a general guide to how strong a pokemon is
* HP: hit points, or health, defines how much damage a pokemon can withstand before fainting
* Attack: the base modifier for normal attacks (eg. Scratch, Punch)
* Defense: the base damage resistance against normal attacks
* SP Atk: special attack, the base modifier for special attacks (e.g. fire blast, bubble beam)
* SP Def: the base damage resistance against special attacks
* Speed: determines which pokemon attacks first each round


## My objectives:
* Understand the dataset and tidying the data if needed.
* Find out most attacking, defensive pokemons.
* Visualize the data to extract insights from the data.
* Analysis the data in different aspects.
